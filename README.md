# FrontendMentor-QR-Code
Hello there!

There's really not much more to say. After completing the first two freeCodeCamp courses (HTML/CSS and Javascript), I had to put it on hold for about three months because I was travelling Europe by train. Now that I'm back in my home country, I've gone over the entire HTML/CSS fCC course again and want to practice to make sure that what I've learned sticks. After a couple of days refreshing and practicing my skylls with other websites like Flexbox Froggy, Grid Garden, Flexbox Zombies, Grid Attack and CSS Diner, I'm not taking on the Frontend Mentor challenges.
